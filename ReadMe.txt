 Thank you for downloading FX.DLL 1.03 SDK!

 This software developers kit (SDK) will provide you
 with all neccessary information on how to use FX 
 library with most efficiency.
 In this SDK I included release version of the 
 FX.DLL 1.03 with FX module, a sample project, SDK 
 articles and... full (!) source-code! 
 Please read this file, before going further :)

 Setup
--------------------------------------------------------

 To setup FX.DLL 1.03 SDK, simply run SETUP.BAS batch
 program. It will copy following files:
 1) DLL.FX to RELEASE\FX.DLL
 2) DLL.FX to SAMPLES\DEMO\FX.DLL

 Setup program will not copy FX.DLL to System directory!

 If you are afraid that SETUP.BAS batch program may
 contain hazardous script, copy the files manually or
 open the batch file with text editor and get sure that
 it is 100% safe!


--------------------------------------------------------
 Sample project
--------------------------------------------------------

 Once the setup is completed, you can check out the
 sample project. Those who downloaded FX.DLL 1.02 SDK
 will find this sample project already seen. But,
 don't run away! I have also made some changes to this
 sample project and it now has got examples also on
 text drawing!
 If you are more interested in FX library, you can
 e-mail me and I will send you some more samples. 
 It is just the case that I wasn't able to upload 
 bigger ZIP to Planet-Source-Code.Com! Hope you will
 forgive me this :)
 I will also try to post some of them onto my website, 
 but I can't guarantee that I will do it today or 
 tommorow, or even next week! 
 Time always is problem for me...


--------------------------------------------------------
 SDK articles
--------------------------------------------------------

 I assume that you are really interested in FX libary,
 if you have read all the boring text this far :)
 Anyway, the SDK articles contents everything around
 FX library, including API declarations, some tips,
 history and other stuff. 
 If you have some questions, e-mail me! You know, I
 can't figure out all the FAQs my self :)


--------------------------------------------------------
 Source-Code
--------------------------------------------------------

 As there were many requests for the source-code in
 previous month, I decided to quit hiding around.
 This submission contents all those 5000 +/- lines
 of code that I was writing for last six months!

 I hope you people will appreciate my work! It would
 be great to get some votes :D
